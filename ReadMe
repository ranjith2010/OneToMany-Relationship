OneToMany-Relationship
======================

Hello Friends,

            Its a Very basic Relationship Application using Coredata. "Don't except too much".

Here you guys can able to get some piece of knowledge in 1 To Many Relationship.
This applicaiton is belongs to Contacts -> Address relationship. Here you can able to hear some good sounds from 'NSFetchResultsController' and relationship{like,Inverse,Cascade}


Info:
====
        One Contact has too many Address rite. So based on this if you create here 1 contact, you can able to update the contact and also add too many addresses. So if you delete the Contact the Address field also will be affect.
